<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I spend a greater portion of my time working on side projects or helping friends with theirs. I tend to continuously have a side project underway, and I love to collaborate on ideas and projects.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>I'm interested in all things design. Game, graphic, software, architecture, carpentry, lately  castles.</p>

<p>
  Video games and eSports. I especially enjoy <a href="https://apps.quanticfoundry.com/profiles/gamerprofile/xHL3YLUvF6jVKK5GAB35mB/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couch co-op games and games that are a social experience</a>.
</p>

<p>Game development, game design, and interactive art. I plan to make my own games soon.</p>

<p>I recently starting learning more about cinematographyâ€•out of a pursuit of better films and anime. I'm a fan of Hayao Miyazaki and Wes Anderson films, but I'm on a journey to learn more about the medium.</p>

<p>
  Third-wave coffee. When I travel I like to explore local coffee shops and roasteries. I am working to perfect my home pour-over.
</p>

<p>I spend way too much time actively looking for new music. I stay most up-to-date with the post-punk and post-hardcore genres, but also enjoy diving into other musical expressionism.</p>
